    Scenario: A submitted application can be amended and re-submitted as a new application
        Given there is no application state stored for CRN "1100964517" and SBI "115482347" and grant "example-grant-with-auth"

        # start
        Given the user navigates to "/example-grant-with-auth/start"
        And completes any login process as CRN "1100964517"
        Then the user should see heading "Example Grant"

        Then the user should be at URL "yes-no-field"
        When the user selects "Yes"
        And continues

        # autocomplete-field
        Then the user should be at URL "autocomplete-field"
        When the user selects "England" for AutocompleteField "Country"
        And continues

        # radios-field
        Then the user should be at URL "radios-field"

            | Option two   |
        And continues

        # number-field
        Then the user should be at URL "number-field"
        When the user enters "100000" for "Enter amount"
        And continues

        # date-parts-field
        Then the user should be at URL "date-parts-field"
        When the user enters the date in a week for DatePartsField "datePartsField"
        And continues

        # month-year-field
        Then the user should be at URL "month-year-field"
        When the user enters month "08" and year "2025" for MonthYearField "monthYearField"
        And continues
    
        # select-field
        Then the user should be at URL "select-field"
        When the user selects "Option two" for "Select option"
        And continues
